# SQL Challenges

## 8 Week SQL Challenge
The 8-Week SQL Challenge, created by Danny Ma, is a hands-on learning experience designed for aspiring data analysts, data engineers, and SQL enthusiasts. The challenge provides eight distinct case studies, each simulating real-world business scenarios. Participants can work with datasets to solve various SQL-based problems, enhancing their skills in data exploration, manipulation, and analysis.
