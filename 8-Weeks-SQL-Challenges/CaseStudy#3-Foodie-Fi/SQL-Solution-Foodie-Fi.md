# Case Study #3 - Foodie-Fi
Challenge Source: https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-3/
<br>

### Introduction
Subscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!
<br>

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!
<br>

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.
<br>
<br>

### Available Data
Danny has shared the data design for Foodie-Fi and also short descriptions on each of the database tables - our case study focuses on only 2 tables but there will be a challenge to create a new table for the Foodie-Fi team.
<br>

All datasets exist within the foodie_fi database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

## A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
<br>
Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

```sql
    WITH A AS (SELECT customer_id
                  , plan_name
                  , start_date
                  , price
               	  , CASE
                    WHEN plan_name = 'trial' THEN CONCAT('Started a ', plan_name, ' on ', CAST(start_date AS TEXT) )
                    WHEN plan_name = 'basic monthly' THEN CONCAT('Switched to ', plan_name, ' on ', CAST(start_date AS TEXT) )
                    WHEN plan_name = 'pro monthly' THEN CONCAT('Switched to ', plan_name, ' on ', CAST(start_date AS TEXT) )
                    WHEN plan_name = 'pro annual' THEN CONCAT('Switched to ', plan_name, ' on ', CAST(start_date AS TEXT) )
                    ELSE CONCAT('Cancelled the subscription on ', CAST(start_date AS TEXT) ) 
                    END AS Description
              FROM subscriptions AS S
              LEFT JOIN plans AS P

## B. Data Analysis Questions

B1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

```sql
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customers_ever_had
    FROM subscriptions
    ;
```

<br>

B2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value

```sql
WITH A AS (SELECT customer_id
               , plan_name
                , TO_CHAR(start_date, 'Month') as Month
             	  , EXTRACT(MONTH FROM start_date) AS Month_No
                , price
           FROM subscriptions AS S
           LEFT JOIN plans AS P
               ON S.plan_id = P.plan_id
           ORDER BY customer_id, start_date)  
SELECT month
    	, COUNT(*) no_of_trial_plans
FROM A
WHERE plan_name = 'trial'

B11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

```sql
/*
Approach
Limit the records to customers who had instances of basic and pro monthly plans
Identify customers with basic monthly plan who has pro monthly as previous plan
*/

WITH A AS	(SELECT customer_id
             	, S.plan_id
             	, start_date
          	FROM subscriptions AS S
         	LEFT JOIN plans AS P
              ON S.plan_id = P.plan_id
         	WHERE S.plan_id NOT IN (0, 3, 4) -- removing trial, annual and churn
             	  AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM start_date) = 2020 
			ORDER BY customer_id, start_date
            ),

	 B AS 	(SELECT *
				, LAG(plan_id) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY start_date) AS previous_plan_id 
			FROM A
             )
SELECT *
FROM B 
WHERE previous_plan_id = 2
;

## C. Challenge Payment Question
The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

- monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
- upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
- upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
- once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

```sql
/*
Approach
First, using LEAD and LAG windows functions to bring start date of the next subscription plan for every record.
Then, generating monthly payment schedule for basic and pro monthly plan, generating annual payment plans and a record for the churns.
Then, removing records that overlaps with the help of next subscription plan start_date
Finally, applying calculationsm based on the cast study question logic
