```sql
TABLE event_identifier {
  event_type INTEGER
  event_name VARCHAR(13)
}

TABLE campaign_identifier {
  "campaign_id" INTEGER
  "products" VARCHAR(3)
  "campaign_name" VARCHAR(33)
  "start_date" TIMESTAMP
  "end_date" TIMESTAMP
}

TABLE page_hierarchy {
  "page_id" INTEGER
  "page_name" VARCHAR(14)
  "product_category" VARCHAR(9)
  "product_id" INTEGER
}

TABLE users  {
