### Introduction
Clique Bait is not like your regular online seafood store - the founder and CEO Danny, was also a part of a digital data analytics team and wanted to expand his knowledge into the seafood industry!
<br>

In this case study - you are required to support Dannyâ€™s vision and analyse his dataset and come up with creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.
<br>

### Available Data
For this case study there is a total of 5 datasets which you will need to combine to solve all of the questions
<br>

<br>

## 1. Enterprise Relationship Diagram
### Using the following DDL schema details to create an ERD for all the Clique Bait datasets.
<br>

Click [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/67698808d16109b4009addb8) to access the DB Diagram tool to create the ERD.

```sql
TABLE event_identifier {
  event_type INTEGER
  event_name VARCHAR(13)
}

TABLE campaign_identifier {
  "campaign_id" INTEGER
  "products" VARCHAR(3)
  "campaign_name" VARCHAR(33)
  "start_date" TIMESTAMP
  "end_date" TIMESTAMP
}

TABLE page_hierarchy {
  "page_id" INTEGER
  "page_name" VARCHAR(14)
  "product_category" VARCHAR(9)
  "product_id" INTEGER
}

TABLE users  {
  "user_id" INTEGER
  "cookie_id" VARCHAR(6)
  "start_date" TIMESTAMP
}

TABLE events   {
  "visit_id" VARCHAR(6)
  "cookie_id" VARCHAR(6)
  "page_id" INTEGER
  "event_type" INTEGER
  "sequence_number" INTEGER
  "event_time" TIMESTAMP
}

Ref: events.cookie_id > users.cookie_id //many to one
Ref: events.page_id > page_hierarchy.page_id
Ref: events.event_type > event_identifier.event_type
Ref: campaign_identifier.products < page_hierarchy.product_id
```

## 3. Product Funnel Analysis

### Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:
- How many times was each product viewed?
- How many times was each product added to cart?
- How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
- How many times was each product purchased?
